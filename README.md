## :dango: Introduction

The **Hydra Pay** project will provide an open-source library and framework for cardano light wallet developers to make use of [Hydra (Head)](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/).

This will cover:

* Spinning up a network (This includes starting and managing hydra nodes)
* An API to make the common operations simple to execute:
  * Initialization
  * Commiting
  * Transactions
  * Querying
  * Closing
  * Disputing
  * Fanout
* A real-world example application

## :construction: Under Construction

**Hyra Pay** is in-progress, and subject to change as the hydra-head protocol and development requirements evolve to meet the demands of light wallet and dApp developers. 

**Hydra Pay** is **NOT** yet ready for production and mainnet.
